    <h3>Website Design Using WordPress (Systems Analysis and Design Class)</h3>
    <p>
      URL: <a href="https://two.parkside.team" target="_blank">two.parkside.team</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      Myself and five others were in charge of building this website for the Women’s Resource Center of Racine. Throughout the semester, we used WordPress to develop and refine the site, making weekly changes based on feedback. Although the WRC had some basic requirements, the design and layout were largely left to our team’s creativity. This project was a great learning experience in both collaboration and front-end web development.
    </p>

    <h3>Database Design for WRC Donations (Systems Analysis and Design Class)</h3>
    <p>
      I personally created the database for the WRC's donation system using Microsoft Access. I followed the WRC's guidelines for what information they record for donations and built the database accordingly. This involved structuring the tables, defining relationships, and creating forms and reports to streamline the data entry and tracking process.
